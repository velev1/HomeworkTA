//Write an expression that calculates rectangle’s area and perimeter by given width and height.
//The width and height should be read from the console.
//Input
//The input will consist of 2 lines:
//On the first line, you will receive a floating-point number that will represent the width of the rectangle.
//On the second line, you will receive another floating-point number that will represent the height of the rectangle.
//Output
//Output a single line - the rectangle's area and perimeter, separated by a whitespace.
//Print the area and perimeter values with exactly 2-digits precision after the floating point
//Constraints
//The width and height will always be valid floating-point numbers.
//Time limit: 0.1s
//Memory limit: 16MB
//Sample tests
//Input   Output
//2.5
//3	7.50 11.00
//5
//5	25.00 20.00
//3
//4	12.00 14.00
