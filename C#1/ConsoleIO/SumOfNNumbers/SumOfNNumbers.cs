//Write a program that enters a number N and after that enters more N numbers and calculates and prints their sum.
//Note: You may need to use a for-loop.
//Input
//On the first line, you will receive the number N
//On each of the next N lines, you will receive a floating-point number
//Output
//On must output only one number - the sum of the N numbers
//Constraints
//1 <= N <= 200
//All numbers will be valid floating-point numbers in the range[-1000, 1000]
//Time limit: 0.1s
//Memory limit: 16MB
//Sample tests
//Input   Output
//3
//20
//60
//10	    90

//5 
//2 
//-1 
//-0.5
//4
//2	        6.5
