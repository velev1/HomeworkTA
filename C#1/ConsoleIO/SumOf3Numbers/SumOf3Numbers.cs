﻿//Write a program that reads 3 real numbers from the console and prints their sum.
//Input
//On the first line, you will receive the number a
//On the second line, you will receive the number b
//On the third line, you will receive the number c
//Output
//Your output should consist only of a single line - the sum of the three numbers.
//Constraints
//a, b and c will always be valid real numbers between -1000 and 1000, inclusive
//Time limit: 0.1s
//Memory limit: 16MB
//Sample tests
//Input   Output
