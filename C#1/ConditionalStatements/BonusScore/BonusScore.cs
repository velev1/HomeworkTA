﻿//Write a program that applies bonus score to given score in the range[1…9] by the following rules:
//If the score is between 1 and 3, the program multiplies it by 10.
//If the score is between 4 and 6, the program multiplies it by 100.
//If the score is between 7 and 9, the program multiplies it by 1000.
//If the score is less than 0 or more than 9, the program prints "invalid score".
//Input
//The only input line will contain one integer number - the score
//Output
//Output the score with the applied bonus
//Constraints
//The score will always be a valid integer number
//Time limit: 0.1s
//Memory limit: 16MB
//Sample tests
//Input   Output
//2	        20
//4	        400
//9	        9000
//10	invalid score
