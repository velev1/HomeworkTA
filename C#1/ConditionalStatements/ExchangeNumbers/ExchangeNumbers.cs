//Write a program that reads two double values from the console A and B, 
//stores them in variables and exchanges their values if the first one is greater than the second one.
//Use an if-statement.As a result print the values of the variables A and B, separated by a space.
//Input
//On the first line, you will receive the value of A
//On the second line, you will receive the value of B
//Output
//On the only output line, print the values of the two variables, separated by a whitespace
//Constraints
//A and B will always be valid real numbers between -100 and 100
//Time limit: 0.1s
//Memory limit: 16MB
//Sample tests
//Input   Output
//5
//3	        3 5

//2
//4	        2 4

//3.3
//3.3	    3.3 3.3
